- You can simply call it as Word Notebook that allows adding 4 word and multiple definitions, manipulating the words added, showing the all list of words as paginated. 
- It's my first local Asp.Net Core 6 Project that I tried to implement what I learnt from Adam Freeman .Net 6 Core Book to overcome the need of digital word notebook for my real physical word notebook.
- The reason that I allowed to add just 4 word is that I decided to add 4 words to my physical notebook, so I wanted word amount to be the same.
